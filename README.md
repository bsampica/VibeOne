# VibeOne

## Mission
VibeOne is software designed to control brewery systems.  Created from the ground up, and not based on other libraries, we aim to use the latest technologies to enable brewers, mixers, and crafters the ability to automate the parts of the process that robots and computers are good at, while leting them focus and experience the parts humans are good at. 

## Technology
We use the following tech to get the job done
- C#
- AvaloniaUI
- Fody Framework
- Fluent Programming
- Raspberry Pi (or other microcontroller)
- **PLANNED TECH, not yet implemented**
- Mqtt (.net) and Mqtt for Arduino
- RF point to point.
- Azure IOT Hubs
- Azure Websites / Functions

### Microcontrollers
There are many parts of this system, that can run directly on the raspberry pi.  In fact it's designed to run out of the box, on a standard raspberry pi model 3 or 4(b). Ultimatly though, the goal is to have the software be platform independant.  So running the software in the cloud, and authoring commands to a microcontroller onsite through MQTT.  Modulatiry is the key to flexibility, we will attempt to support the most modular and flexible system possible.

## Deployments
There are no current releases or deployments planned.  If you'd like to be part of this project in large or small ways, get in touch.  We will send you our _coding guidelines_, our _code of conduct_, and our _pull request cheat sheet _ to get you started.
